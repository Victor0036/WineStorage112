My Motivation behind the App I have been working with wines for many years in the restaurant industry and I am also a part of CampusRådet for VIA Campus C, where a friend of mine and I has a committee for wine enthusiasts at VIA, where we create tastings and events for students at VIA. Therefore, it is obvious for me to create an app, where I can sort wines by my own measures. A lot of already existing apps, which the functionality to store and sort your wines like Vivino and winesearcher, are too complex, not userfriendly enough and has too many features to create a well-functioning app. This is the reason, why I am going to create this initial app to work as an elegant tool with easy navigation for wine enthusiasts, where they can store and keep track of their wines through this app.
